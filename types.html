        <p class="explain">In Sketchup Make the Capabilities are seemingly endless, it’s basically the trimmed down version of Google’s Sketchup Pro. Sweet Home 3D allows you to your create your dream house, and then you can see it come to life. You can import designs if  you already have some planned out. When you’re done you can take a walk-through of your home and take pictures, so you can actually make your house in real life based on the pictures. Blender is the complete package for 3D modeling, texturing, animation and physics.  Blender is very good for people new to CAD, and it will help you start and get the hang of CAD so you can use more experienced software in the future. Oh, and all of these programs are free, so that’s another plus.
