        <p class="explain"><img src="http://blog.monsteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/space-worker.jpg" height="200px" width="270px" style="float: right;"/>CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, and is used by many people in different professions.  It is used by Architects, Engineers, Drafters, and Artists, but it is not  limited to people in these professions. The point of CAD is to help people create 2D drawings or 3D models. CAD had been around for while, but in the 1970’s when CAD started to do more than make Manual Drafts into Electronic ones, companies began to switch to the program because it was cost friendly.

        <p class="explain">As said before CAD is used to aid people in creating 2D drawings or 3D model by the computer. CAD can also be called CADD, the extra D is for Drafting. With CAD you can use design processes such as Drafting, Documentation and Manufacturing processes. You can also add information like materials, dimensions, processes, and more. CAD is a very important tool and is used in making Automotives, in Shipbuilding, and in the Aerospace Industries. Along with that it is used for special effects in movies, in advertising and technical manuals

It was imperfect at the time, but it still was able to manufacture things overnight. In 1999 3D printing started to work with Medicine Business by making Engineered Organs. In 2002 Scientists were able to break through and create a working Kidney through a 3D Printer. In 2008 the RepRap Project created a 3D Printer that could reproduce itself, so people could create more 3D Printers from one.

Sweet Home 3D allows you to your create your dream house, and then you can see it come to life. You can import designs if  you already have some planned out. When you’re done you can take a walk-through of your home and take pictures, so you can actually make your house in real life based on the pictures. Blender is the complete package for 3D modeling, texturing, animation and physics.  Blender is very good for people new to CAD, and it will help you start and get the hang of CAD so you can use more experienced software in the future. Oh, and all of these programs are free, so that’s another plus.

        Here are some of the top rated 3D printers:
        <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Printrbot Simple Maker - One of the if not the best budget 3D Printers right now. It’s cheap ($349), but it’ll get the job done. 
</li>
            <li>Cubify Cube 3 - It’s decently expensive ($999), but if you’re new to 3D Printing it’ll help. 
</li>
            <li>MakerGeeks RepRap Mini Kossel - This printer can reproduce itself, and it’s a fun experience to do so. It also does regular 3D Printer stuff. It is priced at around 800 dollars. 
</li>
            <li>UltiMaker 2 3D Printer Review - This printer is for the 3D printing Enthusiasts, it’s  cheap for what its worth (2500 dollars). 
</li>
          </ul>
